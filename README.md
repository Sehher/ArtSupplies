# Solo Project
## My Art Supplies

### Aim
To create a website with create, read, update and delete functionality 

### My Solution
An art application which allows you to add a product, with a name, category, description and image url. You can add as many products as you want, delete them and edit them.

### Testing
Selenium testing was done in a separate repository.
<https://github.com/Sehher/ArtSuppliesSelenium.git>

### Front End 
My HTML and JS files were initially in this repository, however was moved to a new repository (<https://github.com/Sehher/ArtSuppliesHTML.git>)

### Future Application Improvements
In the future, I would like to add a relational table so that I could have a separate list which is my list and separate from a general supply list. I would also like to improve the update function, so that it isn't necessary to input an ID in order to edit. Currently, it is possible to input the same product several times, this is something I would like to prevent.

Also originally, I wanted to separate the products into categories and would like to implement this sort function in the future.

### Codacy

Codacy came back with a B grade for the ArtSupplies git repository. There were 22 issues with 21 being a problem with code style.
For the HTML repository, Codacy gave a C grade with 8 issues (2 code style, 3 error prone, 3 security).
