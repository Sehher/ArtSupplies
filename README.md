# Solo Project
## My Art Supplies

### Aim
To create a website with create, read, update and delete functionality 

### My Solution
An art application which allows you to add a product, with a name, category, description and image url. You can add as many products as you want, delete them and edit them.

### Testing
Selenium testing was done in a separate repository.
<https://github.com/Sehher/ArtSuppliesSelenium.git>

### Front End 
My HTML and JS files were initially in this repository, however was moved to a new repository (<https://github.com/Sehher/ArtSuppliesHTML.git>)
